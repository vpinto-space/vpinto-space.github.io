I have a long story of love and hate with websites. It all started when I tried to build a personal site using Microsoft Publisher (back in 1998) instead of whatever the alternative was at that time. After that came Geocities and a few other attempts with free webhosts whose names I don't really remember. In 2002, college opened a whole new world with people that actually knew how to do websites using HTML and PHP. So I learned a bit.

My main problem has always been that I'm not good at generating content at a reasonable pace, and that I have always struggled with website design.

I feel that I need to practice writing in English beyond the scientific writing I do from time to time to publish a paper, so here I am.

I'm thankful that I was able to find a static website generator that allows me to showcase my skills at running code in Python (because I'm not really programming a lot to publish this) and to not have to worry about the website design. Plus, It'll force me to learn Markdown.
