Hello! Welcome to my personal website. The main purpose of this site is to share some of my projects, publications and my personal blog. While I plan to write mostly about work related stuff, I'll be probably posting a bit about everything that comes to my mind.

Currently I'm a Ph.D. student in Space Physics at UCLA (even though my diploma will say Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences) with an interest in magnetospheric dynamics and solar wind - magnetosphere interactions. I'm also developing an increasing interest in Data Science so it is very likely that my blog will drift in that direction.

As a small note, I have decided to publish my website in English because I consider that it fits better my current goals (and I really need to practice). However, I'll try to publish as many translations to Spanish as I can. Content in both languages might be different based on my needs or in the relevance of the content.

Website is currently under construction (I'm migrating it to Nikola) so more content will start appearing during the next weeks
