      Hello! Welcome to my personal website. My name is Victor Pinto and I'm a Ph.D. (c) in <a href="http://www.atmos.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences</a> (Space Physics) at at the University of California, Los Angeles.
		</p>
    <p>
      The main purpose of this site is to share some of my projects, publications and personal thoughts. While I plan to write mostly about work related stuff, I'll be probably posting a bit about everything that comes to my mind.
    </p>
    <p>Site is still under construction. Some parts are still not working, but I hope to get it fully functional soon.

    <p>The Earth's magnetic field interacts with the solar wind, protecting the planet from its direct impact. As a result, most of the energy is stored in both the field and the particles residing in it.</p>
	  <p>Space Physics is the field of study that tries to understand the space environment by combining plasma theory, satellite data analysis and simulations. My current research interests are:</p>
		<ul>
		<li>Solar wind-Magnetosphere Interactions</li>
		<li>Radiation Belt Physics</li>
		<li>Space Weather</li>
		</ul>

	  <p><b><i>"Sometimes a simple idea is followed by a long night"</i></b></p></center>
      <p>From time to time I have an idea that results in something that can be potentially useful for others. But unless shared, they are of no use. I hope to change that by organizing a bit my non-academic projects... It'll take time
	  </p>
	  <p>In the meantime, documenting the construction of this website should serve as a good starting point.

      <p>Although scientific writing has helped me learn how to comunicate in a technical language, I feel that I need to do a bit more of general level communication.</p>
      <p>Whether is sharing my thoughts or trying to explain my research to a non-technical audience, this is the place where I pretend to store that content.
